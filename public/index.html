    <h1>My Hobbies</h1>
  </p> Growing up I was a very shy kid, so I didn't make frineds so growing up I played a lot of video games.
   I started playing all of the call of duty game when they came out, and soon fell in love with just playing video games.
    Video games for me was an escape from the real world. I would come home after school
    and just play for hours on end, because it was something that helped me and gave me
    something to do all the time. I had felt that video games was a friend and
    something that wouldn't leave me.
     Recently I still play video games such as Fortnite, PUBG and Rocket league.</P>

   </p> Other hobbies that I enjoy is wathcing TV.
     Love sports, Football, Basketball, Hockey and Golf.
     Hobbies that I would like to learn would be to be able to code.
     I find that being able to do somthing then seening it acutally happen is really cool.
      I feel like coding for me is something that suits me well as it's something that I can do by myself and work on wihtout others.
       Making a hobbie to a carrer for me would be amazing and I can't wait to learn more!
       Hobbies that I once had but fell off was I loved playing sports but I had
       stopped playing sports because I had felt that I wasn't good enough.
       Now looking back I wish I would have played sports to date becasue it's something
       that I miss doing and enjoyed. </p>
